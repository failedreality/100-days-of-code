# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.  Set's and Ranges.  Also found a cool game site for learning, called codecombat.  Its unique and fun, probably made more for the younger kids out there but I found it a good way to learn certain things.

**Thoughts:** Still can't grasp some of the basics but i'm getting there.  The class is fast paced but today it was about sets, set and list comprehesion, list and set spliting, and more conversion from string to int's.

**Link to work:** Files will be uploaded to my repository but its mainly notes and what I'm working on for that section of the class
