# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.  Set's and Ranges.  Also found a cool game site for learning, called codecombat.  Its unique and fun, probably made more for the younger kids out there but I found it a good way to learn certain things.

**Thoughts:** Still can't grasp some of the basics but i'm getting there.  The class is fast paced but today it was about sets, set and list comprehesion, list and set spliting, and more conversion from string to int's.

**Link to work:** Files will be uploaded to my repository but its mainly notes and what I'm working on for that section of the class

**Twitter Post:**  D1 - Learned more about sets and ranges - then found codecombat site someone mentioned on reddit learnpython and had fun going through the first 11 levels but its a pretty fun way to learn #100DaysOfCode


### Day 1: December 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.  List comprehension and set comprehension.  Started looking into pybit.es code challenge site but even the first challenge is a major challenge to me.  So maybe need to find a mentor or just learn more to understand more of it.

**Thoughts:** It's crazy that I am even trying this but, wanting to get more into the security field, Python is a must to learn.  And it wouldnt hurt to be able to develop my own Python code.

**Link to work:** No link today.

**Twitter Post:**  D2 - Learned more about set comprehension and list comprehension.  Looked int pybit.es challenges but I think its still too advanced. #100DaysOfCode
