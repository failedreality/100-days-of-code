# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.

**Thoughts:** Still can't grasp some of the basics but i'm getting there.  The class is fast paced but today it was about sets, set and list comprehesion, list and set spliting, and more conversion from string to int's.

**Link to work:** Files will be uploaded to my repository but its maily notes and what I'm working on for that section of the class
