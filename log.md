# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.  Set's and Ranges.  Also found a cool game site for learning, called codecombat.  Its unique and fun, probably made more for the younger kids out there but I found it a good way to learn certain things.

**Thoughts:** Still can't grasp some of the basics but i'm getting there.  The class is fast paced but today it was about sets, set and list comprehesion, list and set spliting, and more conversion from string to int's.

**Link to work:** Files will be uploaded to my repository but its mainly notes and what I'm working on for that section of the class

**Twitter Post:**  D1 - Learned more about sets and ranges - then found codecombat site someone mentioned on reddit learnpython and had fun going through the first 11 levels but its a pretty fun way to learn #100DaysOfCode


### Day 2: December 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.  List comprehension and set comprehension.  Started looking into pybit.es code challenge site but even the first challenge is a major challenge to me.  So maybe need to find a mentor or just learn more to understand more of it.

**Thoughts:** It's crazy that I am even trying this but, wanting to get more into the security field, Python is a must to learn.  And it wouldnt hurt to be able to develop my own Python code.

**Link to work:** No link today.

**Twitter Post:**  D2 - Learned more about set comprehension and list comprehension.  Looked int pybit.es challenges but I think its still too advanced. #100DaysOfCode  


### Day 3: December 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.  Learned a bit about while loops and then set intersections (code.intersection).  Also covered briefly string split() method.

**Thoughts:** Just trying to plug along and get some time in.  The upcoming weekend will be tough to find the time, but maybe I will just switch over to a book for the weekend, since I cannot have a laptop with me everywhere I am going to.  The next section in the udemy class will get more in depth and will start to learn dictionaries.

**Link to work:** No link today.

**Twitter Post:**  D3 - Learned about while loops, set intersections and string splits.  Moving to book studies for the weekend  #100DaysOfCode  

### Day 4: December 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.  Right now we are learning more about methods and mutliple methods with lists and dictionaries.  The class is supposed to be creating/learning a student grade system.  Also learning how to average the marks of the students and eventually display the student and the average grade(marks(

**Thoughts:** I'm fallen off the wagon, with the amount of real life work that has come up between this gap.  Unfortunately for me, working IT sometimes means long hours and deadlines, but tonight I pressed through and got a little bit done.

**Twitter Post:**  D4 - Methods and multiple methods while using lists and dictionaries within the methods. Still over my head but i'm slowly understanding more and more while going through this udemy class. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 5: December 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued more on the learning class from udemy on Python.  Today was more about the methods and dictionaries used in this little student app we are creating.  Then built a looping menu system to see students and their average grades.  At the end he introduced classes, which replaced some of the code and methods we had to make it simpler and cleaner.  

**Thoughts:** Between dictionaries and methods and now classes, I do believe my head is spinning.  I guess the instructor is pretty fast paced, so I'm trying to retain it all, but it's alot thats for sure.

**Twitter Post:**  D5 Still learning methods and dictionaries and just a hint of classes, which tomorrow will dive more into during the class.  My head is still above water so I'm not drowning yet...  #100DaysOfCode

### Day 6: January 02, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More about classes and importing them in to the main code file.  Then within the classes learned more about filters and using lambda.  Also learned how to write and read from a text file.  

**Thoughts:** Things are going pretty good, however I'm lacking consecutive days so it's tough to retain most things I'm learning in this class.  However, 2018 I'm going to focus more on doing this daily and working through more Python classes.

**Twitter Post:**  D6 Python classes more in depth and use of filters and lambda... Also learned the with block to write and read to a txt file.. building a rental sysem in the class i'm in...  #100DaysOfCode

### Day 7: January 03, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More about classes and developing this little app about a movie rental system.  Also learned how to write out to a txt file in CSV format and tomorrow supposed to learn output the file in json.

**Thoughts:** Today was good.  Still trying to wrap my head around a lot of it, but now seeing what the code can do in a more complex way then just printing varibles is helping grasp it a bit more.

**Twitter Post:**  D7 Python - Learned classes more in depth and use of filters..  Also learned the with block to write and read to a txt file.. Also learned formatting in writing to CSV format and tomorrow json output.  This is leading up to building a rental sysem in the class i'm in...  #100DaysOfCode

### Day 8: January 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up classes and CSV write and read formatting.  Next step was getting rid of all the CSV code and move it to json formattinng.  Then Read and wrote the json to a txt file.  Completed a user menu for the movie rental system and finished up that section of the udemy class.

**Twitter Post:**  D8 Python - Finished classes and worked with writing json output to a txt file and reading from the same file.  Created a user m enu system and tested, completed this section of class.. Next section writing to postgresql #100DaysOfCode #codenewbie

### Day 9: January 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started into the PostgreSQL part of this course I am in.  Had to install it on my windows PC and then we worked on Select, Where, Update and Delete high level queries and worked on displaying the data, and updating prices in a sample items database.  

**Twitter Post:**  D9 #100DaysOfCode Python/PostgreSQL - Today was focused on PostgreSQL installation and basic commands to get familiar.  Select, Update, Where and Delete was learned working with sample data. Next is joins and orders. #makingprogress    #codenewbie

### REBOOT of 100DaysOfCode ###

I have decided to get back on track with this, now that I am studying c++ at the college, which is now forcing me to actually learn something on a daily basis.  So I will most likely start attempting to record my daily coding as I go through this class.  I really should have started this back when class began back in August, but its never too late to start again.  So hopefully I will have some logs to write soon.
